            <h3>Computer Science Teaching Assistant - Department of Computer Science | Colgate University</h3>
            <p>At Colgate University's Department of Computer Science, I've had the privilege of serving as a Teaching Assistant since the Fall of 2022. My primary responsibilities have included tutoring 20 to 30 students each semester. I've passionately guided these students in debugging their code, enabling them to foster enhanced proficiency and confidence in their computer programming journey. Notably, the curriculum delved into advanced algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and dynamic programming.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I conducted weekly open-lab sessions. These sessions were critical in providing hands-on experience, focusing on the optimization of Java and Python code. We delved deeply into the nuances of Object-Oriented programming, dissected complex data structures, and navigated the intricacies of run-time complexities. This role has not only allowed me to impart knowledge but also reaffirmed my own understanding of these foundational concepts. </p>

            <h3>Community Leader - Office of Residential Life | Colgate University</h3>
            <p>At Colgate University, I've proudly served as a Community Leader for the Office of Residential Life since the Fall of 2022. Among my contributions, I've orchestrated events such as the E-sports gaming competition and barbecues, with a focus on bolstering connections between juniors and seniors. Finding funding for these events and seeing them come to fruition has been particularly rewarding.</p>
            <p>In addition to event planning, my role encompasses a deeper commitment to the well-being of the community. It's essential to me that every student feels safe and respected. Hence, I've been proactive in addressing and intervening in instances of discrimination, racism, or sexual misconduct. My aim is always to maintain an environment where everyone feels valued and heard.</p>
