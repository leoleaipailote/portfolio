            <h3>Software Engineer Intern - Promethean Ventures | July 2023 - December 2023</h3>
            <p>In a team-focused environment, we utilized the MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, to develop Amor, a unique student dating app. Inspired by the marriage pact matchmaking system prevalent in colleges, Amor was designed to connect students in a meaningful way. Our efforts were well-received, as evidenced by the app achieving over 500 downloads within its first month. This milestone was a testament to our team's ability to understand and cater to the interests and needs of our target student audience.</p>
            <p>Collaboration was key in our project's success. I worked closely with the back-end team to develop the 'Gossip Room' feature, a standout aspect of Amor. This involved designing and implementing controllers and API routes. Our team efficiently coordinated sprints using Jira, which enabled us to work seamlessly with cross-functional collaborators and ensure timely delivery. We also leveraged GitHub for code management and team collaboration, which streamlined our development process. Additionally, I focused on enhancing the user experience by developing the admin codebase, integrating push notification functionality using web sockets. This allowed for the real-time relay of messages and updates, significantly improving user engagement and interaction within the app.</p>

          <h3>Software Engineer (Part Time) - Colgate University | December 2023 - Present</h3>
          <p>I am actively involved in developing a scheduling application for the Art Department at Colgate University. The project utilizes technologies like React-Native, Node.js, and Express.js to automate the scheduling of office hours and the registration for exhibition events. My role is focused on ensuring the application is straightforward and effective for both students and faculty, addressing the specific needs of the department while enhancing overall efficiency.</p>
          <p>In this project, we are integrating features like real-time availability indicators for faculty members and synchronization with Google Calendar, aiming to streamline the communication between students and faculty. Concurrently, I am employing Docker within a DevOps framework to facilitate testing and to achieve continuous integration and development. This approach is significantly improving our deployment process, making it faster and more reliable, and reducing the incidence of bugs related to the development environment. </p>

            <h3>Computer Science Teaching Assistant - Department of Computer Science | Colgate University | August 2022 - January 2023</h3>
            <p>At Colgate University's Department of Computer Science, I've had the privilege of serving as a Teaching Assistant since the Fall of 2022. My primary responsibilities have included tutoring 20 to 30 students each semester. I've passionately guided these students in debugging their code, enabling them to foster enhanced proficiency and confidence in their computer programming journey. Notably, the curriculum delved into advanced algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and dynamic programming.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I conducted weekly open-lab sessions. These sessions were critical in providing hands-on experience, focusing on the optimization of Java and Python code. We delved deeply into the nuances of Object-Oriented programming, dissected complex data structures, and navigated the intricacies of run-time complexities. This role has not only allowed me to impart knowledge but also reaffirmed my own understanding of these foundational concepts. </p>

            <h3>Community Leader - Office of Residential Life | Colgate University | August 2022 - Present</h3>
            <p>At Colgate University, I've proudly served as a Community Leader for the Office of Residential Life since the Fall of 2022. Among my contributions, I've orchestrated events such as the E-sports gaming competition and barbecues, with a focus on bolstering connections between juniors and seniors. Finding funding for these events and seeing them come to fruition has been particularly rewarding.</p>
            <p>In addition to event planning, my role encompasses a deeper commitment to the well-being of the community. It's essential to me that every student feels safe and respected. Hence, I've been proactive in addressing and intervening in instances of discrimination, racism, or sexual misconduct. My aim is always to maintain an environment where everyone feels valued and heard.</p>
