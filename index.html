          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm a senior at Colgate University, majoring in both Computer Science and Economics. Originally from Bangkok, Thailand, I decided to travel to the U.S. to dive deeper into my academic passions. While I cherish my international background, it's the world of technology, particularly computer science, that truly excites me. I aspire to become a software engineer with a focus on full-stack development, blending my love for both the front-end and back-end aspects of web applications.</p>
          <p>My academic and extracurricular journey equipped me with proficiency in a diverse array of programming languages: Java, Python, JavaScript, and C. My enthusiasm for web development led me to delve deep into the MERN stack, allowing me to craft responsive and intuitive websites. In addition to my expertise with the MERN stack, I've also explored web application development through Django, a powerful Python-based framework. Beyond my technical skills, my experience extends to industry-standard practices; I've actively collaborated in an Agile environment, utilizing tools like JIRA to streamline workflows, prioritize tasks, and drive projects to completion.</p>
          <p>To get a deeper understanding of my capabilities, I invite you to explore the projects I've passionately worked on, detailed under the "Projects" tab on this website. This comprehensive blend of technical expertise and industry experience is what I bring to the forefront of software development.</p>
